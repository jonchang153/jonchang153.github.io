---

I'm an awesome PIC16B student and I am running Jekyll! 
This is my first post. Here I will be trying a few things:

## First thing
1. numbering
2. in
3. lists
4. like
5. this

## Second thing
- bulleted 
- lists

## Third thing
Latex!
$$\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2} = \frac{\pi^2}{6}$$

## Fourth thing
Inserting attractive code
```python
l = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for i in l:
	print(i + 5)
```
